# Code Complete: Read Chapters 1-3

Answer the following questions:

* Have you applied any of the concepts in your previous projects? (2pt)
    * If yes, give an example. (6pt, student either choose yes or no to answer)
    * If not, what are the reasons that prevent you from applying these concepts(6pt, student either choose yes or no to answer)

        Yes, I am the sole developer at the CatCard office where I build applications each day and every time I commit new code I and sending that code through a series of unit, integration and end to end testing environments.


* Anything relevant to your CSE 120 class project in each chapter? (2pt)
    * How or how not? (4pt)

        The talk about the architecture and high-level design will be relevant in my CSE 120 project, because our Rep basically told us that we will be coming up with our own design and will have to build the application from scratch. Allowing us to come up with our own connected architecture for the API services. We will also need to build our API based service in a way so that it may scale up in the long term. As well we have already begun preparing our work environments, by gaining access to the API and doing some research into different lower level approaches so that we may create a high level design over the whole project.


* Any concepts you think you will use in the future? (2pt)
    * Give examples. (4pt)

    I will definitely be learning more and more about scaling smaller systems that only support a few users to supporting thousands of users to millions of requests a day.
